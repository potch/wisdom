    "Be mindful about giving gifts. A gift you give with <em>any</em> expectation is a burden, and people rarely enjoy being given a burden.",
    "In thinking about optimizing how you work, try to distinguish between the parts of your job that are <em>necessarily difficult</em> versus the parts that are harder than they actually need to be. The former is the reason that you get the big bucks, and the latter is the reason why you may often feel like the bucks should be bigger.",
    "Be gracious when someone points out a dumb error that you made. Especially when it comes from someone whom you respect. They’re doing it because <em>they like you</em>, and because they pay attention to stuff that you do.<br>Related: to bad faith actors, you may wish to say something like, “You might just be right” or, “Yeah, life sure is pretty complicated.” Answers to bad faith can and should be extremely personal.",

    "If you feel uncomfortable in small talk situations, first ensure you’re doing a <em>really</em> good job of listening. No, like: actually listening instead of thinking about how uncomfortable you are about being in the conversation.<br>Related: great listeners ask good questions. “And what year was that?” and “Wow, did that feel really weird at the time?” and “Yikes, was that as terrible as it sounds?” are the sorts of things humans ask one another when they’re actively listening to what someone is saying.",

    "People often unintentionally screw up because they don’t realize they’re thinking more about their next thing than their current thing. In life, your next thing will tend to go way better if you focus first on not screwing up your current thing.<br>Related: build a grocery list <em>before</em> you go to the store.

    "Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.<br>Thus: The only events allowed on a serious person’s calendar are commitments about time, location, and effort that will die if they are not successfully completed on a specific day. Full stop.<br>Corollary: If you’re only tentatively committed to a calendar item—especially if the time of the event has not been mutually confirmed—title the event using Spanish-language questions marks. A future event like “<code>¿Pick apples with Aunt Sue?</code>” successfully blocks out the time while also affording a quickly scannable reminder about events that still need to either be formalized or deleted.",

If it’s not your party, you don’t get to pick the music, the guest list, or the vibe. If you can’t find a way to get along, just leave.<br>Relatedly related: a party is only as good as the people who attend it. Especially you.

    "Learn the difference between being “busy” versus being <em>time-constrained</em>. Time constraint is an immutable fact of adult life; while it can (and should) be managed, time constraint can never be eradicated.

    "When you first try to meditate, it’ll feel like you’re doing it wrong and are terrible at it. Eventually, you’ll figure out that being terrible at meditation and feeling like you’re doing it wrong is kind of the whole point of meditation. In truth, as long as you keep getting back to your practice, you are actually great at meditation, and you are doing very well at it.<br>Related: you’ll rarely earn points in life for repeatedly thinking about something you’re not doing. Unless worrying and fretting about something you’re not doing makes you happy, you may wish to worry and fret less.",

    "“Creative work” and “independent work” are rarely the same thing.

Sometimes, perversely so.",
    "In the world of independently making stuff, success with an audience can be thought of as a slice of cake that is impossibly slim but improbably deep.

    "Great cities often thrive on the number of options that ordinary people have for getting from Point A to Point B—and for potentially exploring unfamiliar terrain both between and beyond those points.
